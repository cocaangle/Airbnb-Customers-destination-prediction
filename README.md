# Airbnb-Customers-destination-prediction
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle . 
The purpose for this project is to predict airbnb's new users 's first destination, 
so that airbnb can better allocate its campaign budget.
In the project, I build random forest model to make predictions for testing dataset with an OOB error of 27%, which is a relatively accurate result.
